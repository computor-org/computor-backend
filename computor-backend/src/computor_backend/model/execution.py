# This file previously contained the ExecutionBackend model.
# It has been replaced by the ServiceType model in service.py.
#
# If you need to reference execution backend functionality,
# use ServiceType with hierarchical paths like:
# - testing.python
# - testing.matlab
# - worker.temporal
#
# See docs/SERVICE_TYPE_LTREE_DESIGN.md for details.
