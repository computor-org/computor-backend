## Deprecated Documentation

The [`deprecated/`](./deprecated/) directory contains outdated documentation from earlier versions of the project. These documents should not be used as reference for the current system.

## Contributing to Documentation

When updating documentation:
1. Keep CLAUDE.md as the single source of truth for development setup
2. Update relevant technical docs for architectural changes
3. Mark outdated documentation by moving to `deprecated/`
4. Use clear, concise language
5. Include code examples where helpful
