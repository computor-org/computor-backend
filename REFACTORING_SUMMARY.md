# Course Content Deployment Refactoring Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully refactored the course content deployment system to separate deployment concerns from the hierarchical course structure.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created

1. **`src/ctutor_backend/model/deployment.py`**
   - New models: `CourseContentDeployment` and `DeploymentHistory`
   - Clean separation of deployment logic from course hierarchy

2. **`src/ctutor_backend/interface/deployment.py`**
   - DTOs for deployment operations
   - Interfaces for deployment and history tracking

3. **`src/ctutor_backend/api/course_contents_refactored.py`**
   - New API endpoints for deployment management
   - Clean separation between content and deployment operations

4. **Migration Files**:
   - `add_course_content_deployment_table.py` - Creates new tables and migrates data
   - `remove_redundant_example_id.py` - Removes deprecated fields

5. **`docs/DEPLOYMENT_REFACTORING.md`**
   - Complete documentation of the refactoring
   - Migration guide and API changes

### Files Modified

1. **`src/ctutor_backend/model/course.py`**
   - Added relationship to `CourseContentDeployment`
   - Prepared for removal of deprecated fields

2. **`src/ctutor_backend/interface/course_contents.py`**
   - Removed deployment-specific DTOs
   - Cleaned up interfaces to focus on content hierarchy
   - Added deprecation notices for old fields

## Key Improvements

### Before
- Mixed concerns: Course hierarchy + deployment in same table
- Redundant data: Both `example_id` and `example_version_id`
- Poor audit: Deployment history in JSON
- Deployment fields on non-submittable content

### After
- Clean separation: Dedicated deployment tables
- Single source of truth: Only `example_version_id` in deployment table
- Full audit trail: Proper history table with timestamps
- Validation: Only submittable content can have deployments

## How to Apply Changes

1. **Run the migrations**:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. **Update API imports** in `src/ctutor_backend/api/__init__.py`:
   ```python
   # Replace old import
   from .course_contents_refactored import course_content_router
   ```

3. **Update Temporal workflows** to use new deployment model:
   ```python
   from ..model.deployment import CourseContentDeployment, DeploymentHistory
   
   # Instead of updating CourseContent directly
   deployment = db.query(CourseContentDeployment).filter(...).first()
   deployment.set_deployed(path=..., metadata=...)
   ```

4. **Frontend updates**:
   - Use `/course-contents/{id}/deployment` for deployment info
   - Use `/course-contents/{id}/assign-example` for assignments
   - Stop using deprecated fields

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Architecture**: Single responsibility principle
2. **Better Performance**: Dedicated indexes for deployment queries
3. **Proper Audit Trail**: Full history of all deployment actions
4. **Reduced Redundancy**: No duplicate foreign keys
5. **Type Safety**: Proper validation at database level

## Backwards Compatibility

During transition:
- Old fields marked as deprecated but still present
- Both old and new APIs work (with deprecation warnings)
- Data migrated automatically
- Full rollback available if needed

## Next Steps

1. Test the migrations in development
2. Update Temporal workflows
3. Switch frontend to new endpoints
4. Monitor for any issues
5. Plan removal of deprecated fields (Phase 3)
