"""Business logic layer for Computor backend.

This package contains the core business logic separated from API endpoints.
This separation allows for:
- Better testability
- Reusability across different API endpoints
- Easier application of caching decorators
- Clear separation of concerns

Each module in this package corresponds to a domain area and contains
functions that implement business rules and orchestrate data operations.
